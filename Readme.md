#Rogue Survivor Rezombified

A project aiming to upgrade and modernise Rogue Survivor, a 2D roguelike about living through a zombie apocalypse, orignally made by djack, original source code available here: https://github.com/roguedjack/Rogue-Survivor-Alpha-9

##Stuff left to do:
- DirectX doesn't work, neither sound nor graphics, problem with package
- Game currently only runs in VS Debug Mode, running the exe by itself gives error about not having .Net Core runtime installed
- MAJOR refactor

##Stuff done so far:
- succesfully migrated djack's latest version to .Net Core 3.1
